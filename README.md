# LU-Decomposition-and-Power-Method

This notebook utilizes LU decomposition and the Power method in a 5 Ã— 5 square matrix A. You can adjust the matrix at the end of the kernel.
The code computes:
1. The inverse matrix using the LU method.
2. Determines the largest eigenvalue and eigenvector using the Power method.
3. Calculates the convergence rate of the Power method for the chosen initial conditions as a function of the number of iterations.

This Python code was developed during the Computational Mathematics course as part of the master's program in Computational Physics at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
